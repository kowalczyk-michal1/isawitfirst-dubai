      <p>
        Free People was the name first given to what would eventually become the URBN Inc. family, and resurfaced in 1984 to identify the brand as a wholesale collection. Today, Free People has grown to include, in addition to wholesale, both a significant retail and online presence. Currently, we operate over 100 stores in the U.S. and Canada, as well as three wholesale showrooms whose teams have brought Free People to over 1,200 specialty boutiques and department stores across the globe. In all phases of Free People, we look to inspire our customers, our girls â€“ the sweet and sultry, dreamy and tom-girl - with our assortment of apparel and accessories.</p>
